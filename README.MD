# Homeless Kittens

## Description

A game to improve ones reaction time, on-the-fly decision making, and collaboration with others. A grid is created, and is populated with an entrance tunnel, homes (of a certain color), and conveyor belts. At a random time, a kitten (of a certain color) is popped out of the entrance tunnel, and follows the direction of the converyor belt. Switches exist, and are the main thing the player interacts with. These switches change the direction of a conveyor belt. By using these switches the player makes sure the kittens go to the right home. If the player fails at this, the game ends. As the game progresses, more homes, switches and kittens populate the game. A multiplayer option is available, where two players, play on the same board, but each player only has contol over certain switches. Ensuring the necessity for collaboration inorder to win. Created for the University of Victoria Engineering Competition.
